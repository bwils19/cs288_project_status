            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                A Financial Risk Assessment and Analysis Platform.
                <br> Initial Goals of the Project:
            <ul>
                <li>Develop an intuitive system for uploading and analyzing financial portfolios, including risk metrics, overlap detection, and diversification analysis.</li>
                <li>Create an AI-powered module capable of translating user input into actionable insights, such as stress tests, predictive forecasts, and risk assessments. Important to note
                here that I do NOT plan to implement anything that will give suggested actions to the user, only insights that are (hopefully) valuable enough for the user to make their own 
                informed decision. </li>
                <li>Design algorithms that automatically generate appropriate and interactive visualizations to represent complex financial data effectively.</li>
                <li>Enable seamless integration with external APIs for real-time market updates and external data enrichment.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
