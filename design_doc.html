            <h2>1. Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                The Risk Assessment and Analysis Platform is a web-based solution designed to simplify and streamline the
                process of evaluating financial portfolio risk. The platform provides tools for visualizing diversification,
                assessing overlap, conducting stress testing, and offering predictive analytics to empower asset managers,
                risk managers, and institutional allocators to make data-driven decisions. By leveraging intuitive data
                visualizations, guided workflows, and automated assessments, the platform aims to address pain points in
                an underserved market segment where existing solutions are often overly complex or cost-prohibitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform is targeted at mid-market assest managers, pensions, endowments and smaller shops that lack
                the technical resources and know-how and budgets for the robust existing enterprise-grade solutions such
                as Bloomberg Terminal, BlackRock Aladdin or MSCI RiskMetrics. These organizations often struggle with
                maintaining or developing in-house solutions and are left without an accessible, user-friendly, yet
                powerful alternative.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
            <p>
                This project focus comes from a deep reflection about the kind of work that excites me, the problems I
                want to solve, and how I can create meaningful impact. My initial project idea, a general-purpose
                visualization platform for non-technical people who needed to gain insight from their data was starting to feel
                very uninspired. While it addressed a need it lacked the personal interest and transformative potential
                and focus I seek.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pivoting from a broader idea to a more focused, impactful approach I started to doing research where there
                might be gaps in user needs and existing solutions. Digging through the software review platforms G2,
                Capterra and TrustRadius, I discovered that financial risk assessment tools often receive poor reviews
                due to steep learning curves, unintuitive interfaces, and high costs. These particular issues have left
                mid-market and smaller firms underserved, despite their need for risk assessment tools and solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I sought validation of this idea from industry professionals, including a former Cambridge Associates
                and Wellington Risk Manager who is currently a consultant (including for Tufts), who works closely with
                pensions, endowments and institutional investors. His feedback aligned with my initial research.
                <ul>
            <li>Companies often abandon complex solutions like MSCI RiskMetrics because they require technically skilled
            users to build and maintain reports.</li>
            <li>When these technically skilled employees leave the organization, the organization losses the ability
            to adapt these tools effectively.</li>
            <li>Attempting to build in-house solutions frequently results in unsustainable, resource-drained projects.</li>
        </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                These conversations from industry experts validated the need for a more intuitive, scalable and affordable
                platform. I was really encouraged by the consultant's willingness to provide ongoing feedback and connect
                me with additional industry contacts, helping to ensure the project stays in line with the industry needs.
            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Project Vision</strong></h3>

            <p>
                This project is a user-friendly platform that combines the simplicity of no-code solutions with the
                sophistication required for financial risk analysis. I plan to provide tiered functionality to
                accomodate different budgets and needs, enabling users to:
                <ul>
            <li>Upload and analyze portfolios with automated overlap detection, diversification metrics, and
            risk factor exposure.</li>
            <li>Perform stress tests using historical scenarios or customizable parameters.</li>
            <li>Generate professional reports with visualizations that are easy to interpret and share.</li>
            <li>Leverage predictive analytics for market trends and portfolio behavior.</li>
        </ul>
            By focusing on accessibility, automation, and actionable insights, this platform aspires to bridge the gap
            between powerful enterprise solutions and the unmet needs of smaller organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project presents an opportunity to solve real-world problems, have commercial viability, gain
                valuable insight from industry professionals, and build something I am proud of. The success of this
                project hinges on the ability to simplify complex processes, provide value to users and create a
                pathway to further innovations in financial technology. As I once heard from somebody sometime somewhere,
                "The worst thing you can do is build something and no one gives a shit." I really don't think this is that.

                    <p>This component handles the ingestion of portfolio data from users, supporting common file formats such as CSV and Excel.
                It performs robust validation checks to ensure the uploaded files meet specified criteria for format, size, and structural integrity.
                Key functionality includes metadata extraction (e.g., column names, data types, row counts, and completeness) and transformation of raw input
                into a standardized format suitable for downstream processing. Additionally, this module allows integration of external datasets through API connectors,
                enabling dynamic enrichment of user portfolios with live financial data. I have already tested the AlphaVantage

                It calculates key risk metrics such as beta (measures sensitivity to market movements), volatility (to understand variability in returns),
                and diversification indices (to assess portfolio exposure). Additionally, the module supports filtering, aggregation, and normalization of data,
                ensuring compatibility with visualizations and machine learning models. It incorporates advanced error handling to deal with inconsistencies or
                missing values, and prepares the data for predictive analytics and visualization generation.</p>

                Supported visualizations include risk-return scatter plots, time series performance charts, and diversification breakdowns by sector or asset class.
                Users can customize charts with filters, color schemes, and annotations (these features might go into reach goals). The visualization module also integrates predictive analytics,
                such as forecasts of portfolio performance based on historical data and simulated stress tests to illustrate the impact of adverse market events.</p>

                start with real-time market data from AlphaVantage, of which I have already obtained an API key
                and tested pulling data. There are additional APIs such as YahooFinance, Quandl, Finnhub, and FRED.

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    The Predictive Analytics module provides advanced forecasting and analysis capabilities to enhance
                    portfolio insights and risk management. This module leverages a combination of statistical and
                    machine learning models to extract actionable insights from historical data, enabling users to
                    anticipate market trends, detect anomalies, and make data-driven decisions.
                </p>
                <h3>6.1 Time-Series Forecasting Models</h3>
                <p>
                    Forecasting future trends and portfolio performance relies on robust time-series models.
                    This platform integrates:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):</strong>
                        A classical statistical model that is effective for short- to medium-term forecasts of
                        stationary time-series data. It is ideal for datasets with clear seasonal patterns and stable
                        trends.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prophet:</strong>
                        Developed by Facebook, Prophet is designed for handling irregular or missing data, multiple
                        seasonality patterns, and holiday effects. Its ease of use and interpretability make it a strong
                        choice for business-oriented forecasts.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6.2 Anomaly Detection</h3>
                <p>
                    The system integrates anomaly detection to identify unusual events or data points that may indicate
                    market risks or opportunities. Algorithms include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Isolation Forest:</strong> Efficiently identifies outliers in large datasets by
                        isolating anomalies using random decision trees. This is particularly useful for detecting
                        irregularities in portfolio performance. I have already implemented this feature in a data
                        pipeline I built out for real-time data monitoring at my previous company.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Z-Score and Rolling Averages:</strong> Also developed a lot of this in different contexts
                        at my previous company. This combines statistical techniques to highlight
                        data points that deviate significantly from rolling averages, aiding in early detection of
                        market anomalies.
                    </li>
                    The combination of these two methods will help to inform on rolling, slowly drifting trends as well
                    as daily outliers.
                </ul>

                <h3>6.3 Risk Metric Predictions</h3>
                <p>
                    Predictive models provide insights into key risk metrics, enabling users to assess potential
                    portfolio vulnerabilities. This includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Volatility Forecasting:</strong> Using models like GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive
                        Conditional Heteroskedasticity) to predict future price volatility based on historical trends.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Beta Prediction:</strong> Estimating changes in portfolio sensitivity to market
                        movements using regression-based approaches.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6.4 Portfolio Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                    The platform incorporates portfolio optimization techniques to suggest adjustments for minimizing
                    risk and maximizing returns. Key methods include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mean-Variance Optimization:</strong> A foundational method that uses historical returns
                        and covariances to construct the optimal risk-return portfolio.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Monte Carlo Simulation:</strong> Simulates a wide range of possible portfolio outcomes
                        based on probabilistic inputs, providing a detailed risk analysis.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6.5 Sentiment Analysis (Reach Goal)</h3>
                <p>
                    Incorporates sentiment analysis to evaluate market mood and predict its potential impact on
                    portfolios. This feature utilizes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Processes financial news and analyst
                        opinions to generate sentiment scores.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sentiment Indexing:</strong> Correlates sentiment data with portfolio performance,
                        allowing users to align strategies with market conditions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6.6 Integration of External Factors (Reach Goal)</h3>
                <p>
                    Predictive models integrate external macroeconomic and alternative data to enhance forecasts and
                    provide a comprehensive view of portfolio risks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Macroeconomic Indicators:</strong> Uses FRED data for factors like interest rates,
                        GDP growth, and inflation to contextualize portfolio performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Alternative Data Sources:</strong> Incorporates datasets like ESG metrics (Environmental,
                        Social and Governments metrics),
                        sentiment data, or geopolitical events for deeper analysis.

                AlphaVantage package for this porject, I will have to implement timing restrictions since you can't just
                scrape their API as many times and as often as you want. I will implement messages to inform users
                based on successful or failure from API calls. </li>
                <li>Database error handling will include messages to the user on any information attempting to go

                <p>My focus is on AWS S3 for secure file storage and JWT for user authentication. I'm going to be dealing
                with financial data, even though a lot of it will be open-source, publicly available data, I want users
                to be able to upload their own portfolio positions and that needs to be kept secure. I need to ensure
                secure sessions for each user and secure data storage, which is why I am choosing AWS S3 as my storage

                <p>
                For a lot of the scenarios listed below, I will create unit tests to test as many features as I can
                in an isolated environment.
                <ol>
                <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong>Create new user and ensure that user gets added to the database.
                Login with valid credentials. Confirm redirect to user-specific dashboard. Try logging in with invalid
                credentials and ensure an error message pops up and no routing happens. Try signing up with invalid
                values and ensure error messages pop up. Log out from dashboard and ensure access to protected routes
                are inaccessible until re-login.</li>
                <li><strong>File Uploads:</strong>Upload csv and Excel files. Ensure file is uploaded and metadata is
                displayed. Try uploading file with unsupported format and confirm error message. Try to upload file
                that exceeds file size limits and observe error messages and file is rejected gracefully. Delete a
                previously uploaded file and ensure removal from database. </li>
                <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong>Upload valid portfolio file. Verify beta and risk metrics are
                calculated accurately. Upload a file missing or inconsistent data and ensure appropriate error handling.
                Modify portfoliio data on frontend and ensure risk metrics are reflected and saved to database.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualization Generation:</strong>Generate time series visualization of risk metrics. Apply
                forecast metrics and ensure the values and confidence levels are displayed accurately. Verify the
                correct chart type is generated for the appropriate data (timeseries for well, timeseries data, pie
                charts for asset allotment etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>API Integration:</strong>This will be a big one I think because as with a lot of the APIs
                I have worked with in the past, there are a lot of issues that can go wrong that are out of my control
                and the best I can do is create proper error handling to handle any kind of thing that might pop up.
                Test the pull of individual stock data and ensure it displays properly on the dashboard. Try and
                simulate API outages and hitting rate limits and ensure errors are handled appropriately.</li>
                <li><strong>Portfolio Analysis:</strong>Analyze a portfolio with overlapping assets and verify that
                the results are displayed accurately. Test stress-testing scenarios for specific market conditions
                such as overall drops or interest rate increases/decrease etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Persistence:</strong>Create a portfolio, log out, log back in and ensure all the info
                is still there and accurate. Create a portfolio, log out, log in as another user and create another
                portfolio, log out, log back in as first user and ensure all user dashboards are inaccessible from
                other users and dats persists. Delete a portfolio and ensure it is removed from the database.</li>

            <div class="content">
                <p>The deployment strategy leverages Netlify for the frontend and GitHub for code management, providing a seamless and automated deployment pipeline. The backend services will be hosted on AWS to ensure scalability, reliability, and efficient data processing capabilities.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> The user-facing components of the application will be deployed on
                        Netlify. This approach simplifies continuous integration by linking my GitHub repo
                        to Netlify, allowing automatic updates whenever new code is pushed. I chose this because
                        I am already hosting a website that will be associated with the project there. </li>
                    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> The backend Flask application will be deployed on an AWS EC2 instance
                        or a containerized solution such as AWS Fargate (after I do a scalability and cost analysis on
                        these options). This ensures that APIs and data processing  modules are available 24/7 with
                        robust performance under varying loads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> User-uploaded data and metadata will be stored in AWS S3,
                        offering secure and scalable storage. AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) will handle the relational database
                        needs for user data, portfolio information, and application metadata. I'm using SQLite for
                        development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Domain Integration:</strong> My existing domain that is hosted on Netlify will link to
                        the backend via API calls, maintaining a cohesive user experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Secure HTTPS connections will be enforced for all communications.
                        AWS IAM roles and policies will control access to S3 and RDS, ensuring that user data is
                        protected. <- This is super important.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This configuration balances ease of use, cost efficiency, and scalability, ensuring the platform is
                    production-ready and capable of supporting future growth.</p>

<section id="goals" class="section">
    <button class="collapsible"><h2>11. Reach Goals</h2></button>
    <div class="content">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Real-time data streaming:</strong> Implement functionality to ingest and process real-time
                financial data streams, such as stock prices, portfolio changes, and market trends. This could leverage
                APIs like Alpaca, Polygon.io, or IEX Cloud, and use WebSocket or streaming frameworks like Apache Kafka
                to ensure live updates for users. Real-time streaming would enable dynamic dashboards that adjust
                instantly as new data is received. I consider this a reach goal mainly because the cost associated with
                it is high enough that I would need market adoption and validation to integrate this.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Integration with external APIs for live market updates:</strong> Expand the platform’s
                functionality by incorporating live data from APIs such as Alpha Vantage, Quandl, or Yahoo Finance.
                This integration would allow users to overlay real-time market updates, economic indicators, or
                global risk factors onto their portfolio analyses, offering deeper insights and proactive
                decision-making capabilities. Also cost restrictive at the moment for the same reason as above.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Advanced risk visualizations with custom charting libraries:</strong> Introduce sophisticated
                risk analysis tools such as Monte Carlo simulations, VaR (Value at Risk) visualizations, and
                stress-testing charts. Use advanced charting libraries like D3.js or Plotly for highly interactive,
                customizable visuals. These visualizations could include risk exposure by asset class, geographical
                heatmaps of portfolio distribution (which I personally think is really cool), or time-series
                comparisons of projected vs. actual performance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Automated Reporting:</strong> Allow the user to be able to create dashboards and reports, and
                then be able to get updated reports with automated summaries on a cadence of their choosing, whether it
                be the start of every quarter, every Friday, whatever. Whatever they want. They will also have the
                ability to go in and make changes to reports and those changes will be immediately reflected in the
                reports that are automatically delivered.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These reach goals are designed to elevate the platform from a basic portfolio analysis tool to a
            comprehensive, cutting-edge solution for financial risk management. While not part of the core MVP,
            they represent areas for future development that could significantly enhance user value and market
            differentiation.
